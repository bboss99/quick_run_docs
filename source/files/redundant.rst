==============

There are 3 types of users I would say:

1. Those who don't know coding, they can copy python commands and use info panel.

2. Those who aren't expert but understand `variables and functions` and can write `if, for, while etc` you can really
    exploit it. This level of skill is enough to fully utilize it

3. Those who are fairly good in python ,who can create classes and other oop stuff. You can utilize it to it's full
    capacity.


Level 1
---------
This is very basic, coping from info panel, copying python command, history copying methodd
When you want a button, to run a sequence of python commands, you won't have to create an operator anymore.

* If functions are defined elsewhere, like in modules or addons folder, you can call those function from here.
* calling operators.
* copying from info panel.

.. note::

    These documentations are written in a very formal and easy to understand, tutorial like format.

    This pages also contains a lot of examples and many examples will be added in future.



.. NOTE::

    It goes without saying that knowledge of blender api (python or c/c++), 3D in general, Programming and 3d math,
    will go a long way. These are long term pursuits and this package won't help you with that.

After you have installed, best way to get started is following the tutorials.
